# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Successfully compile the entire codebase with `/std:c++23` and leverage modern C++23 features to improve code quality, safety, and maintainability without breaking existing functionality.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Build System

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Build System)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-15 - Completed 01-02 (C++23 flag for dependent projects)

Progress: [=====-----] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Build System | 2 | 3 | 14 min |
| 2. Error Handling | 0 | 3 | - |
| 3. Compile-Time | 0 | 3 | - |
| 4. Code Quality | 0 | 4 | - |
| 5. Documentation | 0 | 2 | - |
| 6. Verification | 0 | 4 | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 12 min, 15 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Target C++23 with `/std:c++23preview` flag (stable flag not yet available)
- [Init]: Use v143 toolset to maintain Windows 7+ compatibility
- [Init]: Incremental modernization - fix compile errors first, then refactor
- [01-01]: Used stdcpp23 enum value (VS 2026 uses this for /std:c++23preview)
- [01-01]: 42 compile errors expected - const-correctness issues from /Zc:strictStrings
- [01-02]: Applied stdcpp23 pattern consistently across all 6 dependent projects
- [01-02]: Deferred linking errors - dependent projects cannot build until EIDCardLibrary compile errors are fixed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- EIDCardLibrary has 42 compile errors that must be fixed before dependent projects can link

## Key Constraints (from research)

- **LSASS context:** No exceptions, no console I/O, static CRT required
- **Windows 7 support:** Must use v143 toolset (v145 drops Win7)
- **C++23 flag:** Use `/std:c++23preview` (stable `/std:c++23` not yet available)
- **C-style APIs:** Preserve HRESULT/BOOL at exported boundaries
