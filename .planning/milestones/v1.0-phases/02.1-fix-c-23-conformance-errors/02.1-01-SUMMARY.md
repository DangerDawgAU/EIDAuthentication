# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-02
    provides: C++23 flag configuration for all projects
provides:
  - C++23 conformance fixes for EIDCardLibrary (C4596, C7510, C3861)
  - EIDCardLibrary builds successfully with /std:c++23preview
  - Template code with proper typename keywords for dependent types
affects: [02-error-handling, all dependent projects]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - typename keyword for all dependent type iterators in templates
    - Unqualified member declarations within class definitions

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - EIDCardLibrary/credentialManagement.h
    - EIDCardLibrary/CContainerHolderFactory.h
    - EIDCardLibrary/CContainerHolderFactory.cpp

key-decisions:
  - "Removed redundant class:: qualifiers from member declarations (C++23 conformance)"
  - "Added typename keyword for std::list<T*>::iterator dependent types"
  - "Added GPO.h include to resolve GPOPolicy enum dependency"

patterns-established:
  - "Pattern: Member declarations inside class definitions must not use class:: qualifier (C++23 /permissive-)"
  - "Pattern: Template dependent types like std::list<T*>::iterator require typename keyword"

# Phase 02.1 Plan 01: Fix C++23 Conformance Errors Summary

**Fixed 7 C++23 conformance errors (3 C4596 illegal qualified names, 3 C7510 typename errors, 1 C3861 missing identifier) enabling EIDCardLibrary to build with /std:c++23preview flag.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T10:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T10:42:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Eliminated all C4596 "illegal qualified name" errors in header files
- Fixed all C7510 typename errors in template code
- Resolved C3861 missing identifier error with proper include
- EIDCardLibrary now builds successfully with C++23 flag

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix C4596 illegal qualified name errors in header files** - `65e07c1` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix C3861 missing identifier error by adding GPO.h include** - `fdba2c3` (fix) - combined with Task 3
3. **Task 3: Fix C7510 typename errors in template functions** - `fdba2c3` (fix) - combined with Task 2
4. **Task 4: Verify full solution builds without C4596/C7510/C3861 errors** - checkpoint approved

## Files Created/Modified
- `EIDCardLibrary/credentialManagement.h` - Removed redundant `CSecurityContext::` and `CUsermodeContext::` qualifiers from static member declarations
- `EIDCardLibrary/CContainerHolderFactory.h` - Removed redundant `CContainerHolderFactory<T>::` qualifier from CreateContainer declaration
- `EIDCardLibrary/CContainerHolderFactory.cpp` - Added `#include "GPO.h"` and added `typename` keyword to 3 iterator declarations (lines 371, 410, 447)

## Decisions Made
- Combined Tasks 2 and 3 into single commit as they modified the same file
- Used `typename` keyword for iterator types rather than converting to `auto` to maintain explicit typing and minimize diff scope

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

**Verification revealed additional const-correctness errors:**
- During checkpoint verification, new C2664 errors were discovered in EIDCredentialProvider and EIDConfigurationWizard projects
- These are const-correctness issues similar to those fixed in Phase 2 (02-01a, 02-01b) but in different projects
- These are **outside Phase 2.1 scope** and do not affect the C4596/C7510/C3861 fixes
- Recommend creating follow-up plans (02.1-02, 02.1-03) to address these if needed

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- EIDCardLibrary builds successfully with C++23
- Phase 2 error handling work can continue
- Note: Dependent projects (EIDCredentialProvider, EIDConfigurationWizard) have additional const-correctness errors that may need separate resolution
