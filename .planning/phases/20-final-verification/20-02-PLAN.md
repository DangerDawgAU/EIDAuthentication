<objective>
Verify the build compiles cleanly after all v1.2 modernization changes and document milestone completion.

Purpose: Confirm no build regressions from Phase 15-19 code changes and create milestone sign-off documentation.
Output: Build verification results and milestone sign-off in STATE.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Verify full solution build</name>
  <files>N/A - Build verification only</files>
  <action>
    Run a full clean and rebuild of the entire solution to verify all projects compile successfully.

    Steps:
    1. Navigate to the solution directory
    2. Run MSBuild clean for the entire solution
    3. Run MSBuild rebuild for Release|x64 configuration
    4. Capture and review build output
    5. Verify zero errors and check for any new warnings

    Build command pattern:
    ```
    msbuild EIDAuthentication.sln /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
    msbuild EIDAuthentication.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run the build and verify:
    ```
    msbuild EIDAuthentication.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /v:m
    ```
    Expected output: "Build succeeded" with 0 errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 7 projects compile with:
    - 0 errors
    - No new warnings (compare to baseline)
    - Release|x64 configuration successful
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Document milestone completion</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
    Update STATE.md to reflect v1.2 milestone completion.

    Update the following sections:
    1. Current Position - change to Phase 20 Complete, v1.2 shipped
    2. Progress - change to 100% (20/20 phases complete)
    3. v1.2 Phases Summary - mark Phase 20 as Complete
    4. Next Steps - change to "v1.2 milestone complete, await user testing"
    5. Add v1.2 completion timestamp

    Also ensure VERIFICATION.md is up to date with final scan results.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Read STATE.md and confirm:
    - Phase 20 marked Complete
    - Progress shows 100%
    - v1.2 completion documented
  </verify>
  <done>
    STATE.md updated with:
    - Phase 20: Final Verification - Complete
    - v1.2 Code Modernization milestone marked shipped
    - Progress: 100% (20/20 phases)

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create Phase 20 summary</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/20-final-verification/20-02-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
    Create a summary document for Phase 20 execution.

    Include:
    1. Build verification results (errors, warnings, configuration)
    2. SonarQube status (from user confirmation)
    3. v1.2 milestone summary
    4. Key achievements across Phases 15-19
    5. Total issues fixed vs documented as Won't Fix
  </action>
  <verify>
    Confirm 20-02-SUMMARY.md exists and contains:
    - Build results section
    - Milestone completion summary
    - v1.2 statistics
  </verify>
  <done>
    20-02-SUMMARY.md created with complete phase documentation.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>
