<objective>
Update project documentation (README.md and BUILD.md) to reflect C++23 modernization, including the `/std:c++23preview` compiler flag, v143 toolset requirement for Windows 7+ compatibility, and clear documentation of the 2026 C++23 upgrade effort.

Purpose: Ensure developers and users understand the C++23 requirements and build toolchain needed to compile and run the codebase. The documentation must accurately reflect the changes made in Phases 1-4 of the modernization roadmap.

Output: Updated README.md and BUILD.md with clear C++23 requirements and build instructions.

  <name>Task 1: Update README.md with C++23 requirements</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md to accurately reflect C++23 modernization:

1. **Platform badge** (line 6): Change from "Windows Vista SP1+" to "Windows 7+"

2. **Quick Start - Prerequisites section** (lines 41-47):
   - Change "Windows Vista SP1 or later" to "Windows 7 or later"
   - Change "Visual Studio 2025" to "Visual Studio 2022 or later"
   - Add note about v143 toolset requirement for Windows 7+ compatibility

3. **Build Configuration section** (lines 195-203):
   - Change "Language Standard: C++14" to "Language Standard: C++23 (/std:c++23preview)"
   - Change "Toolset: v143" (keep this - it's correct)
   - Add note about static CRT (/MT) for Release builds

4. **Add new "2026 C++23 Modernization" section** after "### 2026 Updates" (after line 35):
   ```
   ### 2026 C++23 Modernization

   The codebase has been upgraded to C++23 with the following improvements:

   - **Language Standard:** C++23 with `/std:c++23preview` flag
   - **Toolset:** v143 (for Windows 7+ compatibility)
   - **Error Handling:** `std::expected<T, E>` for internal error handling
   - **Compile-Time:** Enhanced `constexpr` validation and `std::to_underlying()` for enums
   - **Code Quality:** `std::format` for text formatting, `std::span` for buffer handling
   - **All 7 projects** configured for C++23 compilation
   - **Zero regressions** in authentication functionality

   See [.planning/ROADMAP.md](.planning/ROADMAP.md) for complete modernization details.
   ```

5. **Known Limitations section** (line 389): Change "Windows Vista SP1+" to "Windows 7+"

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update BUILD.md with C++23 build requirements</name>
  <files>BUILD.md</files>
  <action>
Update BUILD.md to accurately reflect C++23 build requirements:

1. **Required Software section** (lines 8-12):
   - Change "Visual Studio 2025 Community" to "Visual Studio 2022 or later"
   - Change "Platform Toolset: v145" to "Platform Toolset: v143"
   - Add note: "Note: v143 toolset is required for Windows 7+ compatibility (v145 dropped Win7 support)"

2. **Build Environment section** (lines 148-153):
   - Change "Language Standard: C++14" to "Language Standard: C++23 (/std:c++23preview)"
   - Change "Runtime: Multi-threaded DLL (/MD for Release, /MDd for Debug)" to "Runtime: Multi-threaded Static (/MT for Release, /MTd for Debug)"
   - Add note: "Static CRT is required for LSASS compatibility"

3. **Add new "C++23 Modernization Notes" section** after "Build Environment" (after line 153):
   ```
   ### C++23 Modernization Notes

   This project uses C++23 language features with the MSVC compiler. All 7 projects
   in the solution are configured with `<LanguageStandard>stdcpp23preview</LanguageStandard>`.

   **Key Requirements:**
   - Visual Studio 2022 or later (v143 toolset for Windows 7+ compatibility)
   - `/std:c++23preview` compiler flag (set via project configuration)
   - Static CRT linkage (/MT) for LSASS-loaded DLLs

   **Modern Features Used:**
   - `std::expected<T, E>` for type-safe error handling
   - `std::format` for text formatting (non-LSASS components)
   - `std::span<T>` for bounds-safe buffer access
   - `std::to_underlying()` for enum conversions
   - Enhanced `constexpr` and `noexcept` specifications

   For details on the modernization effort, see [.planning/phases/](.planning/phases/).
