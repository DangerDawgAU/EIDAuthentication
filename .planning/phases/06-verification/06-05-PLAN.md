<objective>
Create comprehensive verification summary and User Acceptance Test documentation for Phase 6.

Purpose: Consolidate all Phase 6 test results (build verification, LSA package, Credential Provider, Configuration Wizard, Password Change) into official verification documentation. Determine if C++23 modernization is complete and all authentication functionality works without regression on Windows 7, 10, and 11.

Output: Official VERIFICATION.md documenting all VERIFY-01 through VERIFY-05 requirements, UAT.md with User Acceptance Test results, and updated ROADMAP.md with Phase 6 completion status.
