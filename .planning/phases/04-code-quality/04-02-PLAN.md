<objective>
Document QUAL-02 (Deducing This) as NOT APPLICABLE to this codebase

Purpose: QUAL-02 was included in planning as a potential C++23 improvement, but codebase analysis confirms ZERO CRTP patterns exist. Deducing `this` is a C++23 feature specifically designed to modernize CRTP code - without CRTP, there is nothing to modernize.

Output: REQUIREMENTS.md updated with QUAL-02 status and justification

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update QUAL-02 status in REQUIREMENTS.md</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
1. Read .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
2. Find QUAL-02 requirement section
3. Add status note: "**Status: NOT APPLICABLE**"
4. Add justification: "Codebase contains ZERO CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) implementations. Deducing `this` is a C++23 feature specifically designed to modernize CRTP code. Without existing CRTP patterns, there are no candidates for deducing `this` modernization."
5. Reference research findings from 04-RESEARCH.md section "QUAL-02: Deducing `this` - NOT APPLICABLE"

DO NOT create any CRTP patterns or deducing this implementations - this is documentation-only.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A5 "QUAL-02" "C:/Users/user/Documents/EIDAuthentication/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md"</verify>
  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md documents QUAL-02 as NOT APPLICABLE with clear justification</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify no CRTP patterns exist in codebase</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
1. Search codebase for CRTP patterns:
   - `template.*class.*Derived`
   - `using Derived|class Derived :.*Base<Derived>`
   - `static_cast<Derived\*>(this)` pattern
2. Verify ZERO matches in .cpp and .h files (excluding .md docs)
3. This confirms research finding that QUAL-02 is not applicable

Expected result: No CRTP patterns found (same as research finding).
  </action>
  <verify>grep -r "static_cast.*Derived.*this" --include="*.cpp" --include="*.h" "C:/Users/user/Documents/EIDAuthentication" | grep -v ".planning" || echo "No CRTP patterns found - QUAL-02 confirmed NOT APPLICABLE"</verify>
  <done>Verified: No CRTP patterns exist in codebase - QUAL-02 definitively not applicable</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. REQUIREMENTS.md shows QUAL-02 as NOT APPLICABLE
2. Justification explains the absence of CRTP patterns
3. Codebase verification confirms no CRTP implementations exist
4. No code changes were made (documentation-only plan)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. QUAL-02 requirement marked as NOT APPLICABLE
2. Clear justification documented in REQUIREMENTS.md
3. Codebase verification confirms no CRTP patterns exist
4. Phase 4 success criteria updated to reflect QUAL-02 status
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-code-quality/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
